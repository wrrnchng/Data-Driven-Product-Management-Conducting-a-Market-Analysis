Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.\n\n### Data Used for Regression\n- **Aggregated Data:** Daily grain.\n- **Columns Used:**\n  - `date`\n  - `power_consumption` (output variable derived from original column: `Global_active_power`)\n- **Preprocessing Steps:**\n  - Removed rows with missing values.\n  - Aggregated daily power consumption by summing `Global_active_power`.\n  - Split data into training and testing sets based on the date.\n  - Created new temporal features from date column: `year`, `semester`, `quarter`, `day_in_week`, `week_in_year`, `day_in_year`, and `month`.\n\n### Citation\nHebrail, Georges and Berard, Alice.
